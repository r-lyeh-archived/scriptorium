Dao is a lightweight and optionally typed programming language
with many interesting features. It includes features that can
make concurrent programming much simpler. It has well designed
interfaces for easy embedding and extending.

* linux
* macosx
* freebsd
* openbsd
* mingw
* minix

Then run the following to install:

$ make install

How to Customize Building?
--------------------------

Build mode (release, debug or profile) and installation directory
can be set by:

$ make -f Makefile.daomake PLATFORM MODE=debug INSTALL=directory

Out of source building can be done by executing the following
from the build directory:

$ make -f DAO-DIR/Makefile.daomake PLATFORM SRCDIR=DAO-DIR

Please read Makefile.daomake for more options such as making
static build etc.
