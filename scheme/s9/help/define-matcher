These constructs allow to write programs using pattern matching
style. The MAKE-MATCHER procedure creates a matcher from the
given clauses which are represented by LISTs. Each <clause> must
have the form:

      (<pattern> ... => <expression> ...)

where each <pattern> is a Scheme datum and <expression> is an
arbitrary expression. MAKE-MATCHER returns a list resembling
a procedure which matches its argument list against the list of
<pattern>s and evaluates the expressions associated with the
first match.

Each pattern is matched against the corresponding argument as
follows:

- Atomic objects, except for symbols, match themselves;
- The symbol NIL matches the empty argument list (so
  (nil => foo) is equal to (=> foo);
- The symbol @ binds the remaining arguments to the subsequent
  symbol and ends the match successfully -- it is the matcher's
  equivalent to Scheme's improper argument lists;
- Symbols match any value and bind the symbol to that value;
  the <expression>s will be evaluated with these bindings in
  effect;
- The symbol _ matches any value, but does not bind to it;
- A quoted symbol matches the symbol being quoted;
- A list is matched by matching its members recursively.

The SYMBOL passed to MAKE-MATCHER is the name of the resulting
matcher. It is merely used for error reporting. In order for
a matcher to recurse, it must be bound using DEFINE-MATCHER
or LET-MATCHER.

The DEFINE-MATCHER syntax binds a matcher to a symbol at the
top-level. LET-MATCHER binds a matcher locally. These constructs
correspond to DEFINE and LETREC.

(begin
  (define-matcher len
    (()      => 0)
    ((_ . x) => (+ 1 (len x))))
  (len '(a b c d e f)))                  ==>  6

(let-matcher how-many
  ((nil
     => 0)
   (_ @ more
     => (+ 1 (apply how-many more))))
  (how-many 1 2 3 4 5))                  ==> 5

(let-matcher appnd
  ((() x      => x)
   ((h . t) x => (cons h (appnd t x))))
  (appnd '(a b c) '(d e f)))             ==>  (a b c d e f)
