	   [pit] point in time and [jpit] julian point in time.
	
2008-07-13 Uwe Klein <uklein@klein-messgeraete.de>

	* This adds open async, fileevents and sockets ( tcp server, client )

2008-07-07 Duane Ellis <openocd@duaneellis.com>

src/jim.c: This simple patch adds precision support to JIM's format command.
	
2008-07-07 Duane Ellis <openocd@duaneellis.com>

src/Jim.c
	- ** THIS INCLUDES A PREVIOUS PATCH I SENT EARLIER **
	- that impliments many [format] specifies JIM did not support.
	- Jim_FormatString() - **MAJOR** work.
	- Previously only supported "%s" "%d" and "%c"
	- And what support existed had bugs.
	- NEW: *MANY* formating parameters are now supported.
	- TODO: The "precision" specifier is not supported.

	** NEW ** This patch.
	
	- Jim_StringToWide() test if no conversion occured.
	- Jim_StringToIndex() test if no conversion occured.
	- Jim_StringToDouble() test if no conversion occured.

	** NEW ** This Patch. Major Work.
	- Previously output from JIM did not get sent to GDB
	- Ditto: Output to Telnet session.
	- Above items are now fixed - By introducing callbacks
	  new function pointers in the "interp" structure.

	- Helpers that call the callbacks.
	
	- New function: Jim_fprintf()
	- New function: Jim_vfprintf()
	- New function: Jim_fwrite()
	- New function: Jim_fread()
	- New function: Jim_fflush()
	- New function: Jim_fgets()

	By default: the output is to STDIO as previous.
	The "openocd.c" - redirects the output as needed.
	
	- Jim_Panic() - Send panic to both STDERR and the interps
	specified STDERR output as a 2nd choice.

	- Now JIM's "stdin/stdout/stderr" paramters are "void *"
	and are no longer "FILE *".

src/Jim.h
	- **MAJOR**
	-  New JIM STDIO callbacks in the "interp" structure.
	-  change: "stdin/stdout/stderr" are now "void *" cookies.
	-  New JIM stdio helper functions.



2008-06-17 Andrew Lunn <andrew@lunn.ch> / oharboe 

	* ChangeLog, jim-aio.c: Andrew spotted a bug in the 
	aio.gets implementation for lines that are more than
	AIO_BUF_LEN long. GCC 4.3.1 pointed out this problem.
	
2008-06-16 oharboe

	* retire CVS keyword expansion. Plays havoc with patches.

2008-06-16 Uwe Klein wiederling at googlemail.com 

	* ChangeLog, jim.c: fixed parsing in "expr 0x1234".

2008-06-16 oharboe

	* ChangeLog, ecos/ecos.db: eCos repository smoketested.
	
2008-06-15 oharboe

	* ChangeLog, jim.c, jim.h, jim-aio.c: Support for eCos.	
	* ChangeLog, jim.c: realloc/malloc(0) fix. Convert
	realloc/malloc(0) => realloc/malloc(1) which has an
	identical implementation, whereas realloc/malloc(0) is
	ambigous. "string map {} {}" used to result in malloc(0)

2008-06-13 oharboe
	
	* ChangeLog: �yvind Harboe's first test as a committer.

2006-11-06 21:29  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c, jim.h: Jim_GetStdin/out/err API removed, now
	  Jim-SetStdin/out/err returns the old value if called with NULL.
	  JIM_NL define introduced in order to force Jim to output CRLF
	  instead of just LF in the core output printf/fwrite calls. This
	  appears to be useful in some kind of terminal under eCos.

2006-11-06 17:54  antirez

	* jim-aio.c: Jim-aio is now able to be statically linked with jim.c
	  on systems like eCos where there is no dynamic libraries support.

2006-11-05 01:26  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c: {*} as alias for {expand} like in recent Tcl
	  8.5 versions

2006-11-02 23:39  antirez

	* ChangeLog: [no log message]

2006-11-02 23:38  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c, jim.h: Ability to configure file descriptors
	  for standard input, output, error.  Default is
	  stdin,stdout,stderr but it's possible to change the default after
	  creating the interpreter using Jim_(Set|Get)(Stdin|Stdout|Stderr)
	  if needed.

2006-11-02 00:31  antirez

	* AUTHORS, ChangeLog: Minor doc typo

2006-11-01 18:18  antirez

	  existing key in dictionary

2006-11-01 14:37  antirez

	* jim.c, jim.h: Fix to expr parsing (now hex digits work as
	  literals).  the exit command is now implemented as a special
	  return value of JIM_EXIT.

2005-09-19 17:56  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim-eventloop.c: Fixed a bug reported by Craig Denson
	  about jim-eveloop.c and filemasks.

2005-09-19 17:47  antirez

	* BUGS, ChangeLog, jim.c: Updated BUGS, fixed some minor problem
	  with GCC 4.x compilation.

2005-09-19 16:17  antirez

	* doc/Sqlite-Extension.txt: Added info about in-memory databases in
	  the Sqlite extension doc.

2005-04-26 15:31  patthoyts

	* jim-win32.c: Check available windows target version for more
	  things.

2005-04-26 12:47  antirez

	* ChangeLog, Makefile, jim-win32.c: mingw compilation fix
	  (excluding the compilation of animate window win32 cmd)

2005-04-21 09:35  patthoyts

	* jim-win32.c: RegisterClass, CreateWindow and UpdateWindow. Need
	  to add user defined Window procedures though.

2005-04-20 17:34  patthoyts

	* jim-win32.c: Added some window managing APIs - MoveWindow,
	  ShowWindow, DestroyWindow and AnimateWindow (which doesn't seem
	  to work).

2005-04-19 17:33  patthoyts

	* jim-win32.c: Added CreateDirectory and RemoveDirectory

2005-04-18 10:31  antirez

	* ChangeLog, Makefile, jim-eventloop.c, jim-eventloop.h, jim.c,
	  jim.h: First version of the Jim eventloop extension, exporting
	  [after], [vwait], and the C API to write other extensions using
	  events. No win32 port for now, just posix. UDP extension will
	  follow shortly and will be the first extension using the event
	  loop.

2005-04-13 21:57  patthoyts

	* jim-win32.c: Added GetLastInputInfo API

2005-04-13 21:54  patthoyts

	* jim-win32api.c: Win32API module permits dynamic creation of Jim
	  commands that call into Win32 DLL functions. Its not complete and
	  at the moment only void or integer parameters are working.

2005-04-13 21:50  patthoyts

	* jimsh.c: JimGetExePath needs to be a _path_ not the file name.

2005-04-12 14:36  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim-aio.c: AIO fix: the Id is not get with the
	  GetGlobalVar function.

2005-04-12 14:27  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c: string tolower/toupper support

2005-04-12 10:34  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim-aio.c: new methods for AIO files, 'read' and
	  'eof'. Documentation still no longer in sync.

2005-04-11 19:25  chi

	* jim.c: - Remove the '%lu' scan format specification. The largest
	  possible type   in the Jim core is jim_wide. That type is a
	  signed one. A unsigned   variante of jim_wide is not forseen. So
	  a '%lu' specification seems not   to make any sense.

	  - Some extra castings necessary to let the Jim core interpreter
	  compile and	run under Tru64U on Dec Alpha.

	  - Fix a bug in UpdateStringOfList(). If a list was created via
	  the Jim   command [list] w/o any argument, the internal
	  representation of that list	pointed to ZERO and the len
	  attribute was equally set to ZERO. If now   UpdateStringOfList
	  was called to create the string representation of   the list,
	  Jim_Alloc for quotingType got a ZERO size for number of bytes
	  to allocate. That let to SIGSEGV under Tru64U, so I changed that
	  to   allocate at least 1 byte then.

2005-04-11 16:34  antirez

	* ChangeLog, TODO, jim.c: RHS/Nem vision about [tailcall]
	  implementation/behaviour is now Jim's way to go.

2005-04-11 13:17  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c: [tailcall] command added

2005-04-11 10:25  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c, jimsh.c: Fixes for this two bugs:

	  (1) jim.c   Jim_FormatString()       char array spec[] is defined
	  as having two elements but at the 'default:' case of the switch
	  statement an assignment is made to the third element

	  (2) jimsh.c  JimGetExePath()	     After the call of strrchr()
	  the value of p could be NULL in the case that argv[0] is just
	  plain "jim". The next line should have a test for NULL added to
	  avoid dereferencing the NULL pointer.  (This is the cause of a
	  Bus Error on Mac OS X.)

	  Many thanks to Colin McPhail for reporting this two problems.

2005-04-10 19:04  chi

	* jim.c, jimsh.c: Rework of the [scan] command finished. It does
	  not any longer use sscanf for scanning purposes, only for parsing
	  within SetScanFmtFromAny. We could get rid of it there too, if
	  necessary.

	  It pass all tests on all platforms I had access to (mainly Linux,
	  Solaris, FreeBSD, MacOS X). But I am confident, that it will pass
	  on the others as well.

	  A small new introduced C99-ism was fixed in jimsh.c as well.

2005-04-10 11:51  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c, jim.h: Fix for [return -code eval]

2005-04-09 14:57  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c, jim.h: Experimental verison of JIM_EVAL retcode
	  in order to implement what RHS proposed in the Wiki for tail
	  recursion:

	  return -code eval [list proc $a $b ...]

	  I'm not sure I'll take this, but it needs to be inside for some
	  time in order to experiment and evaluate it I guess.

2005-04-09 10:23  antirez

	* ChangeLog, TODO, jim.c: TODO updated, spurious free changed into
	  Jim_Free().

2005-04-08 16:07  patthoyts

	* jim-win32.c: Do not add cursorinfo if build target cannot cope.

2005-04-08 16:06  patthoyts

	* jim.c, jimsh.c: Fix win32 build

2005-04-07 09:27  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jimsh.c: Fixed a typo that prevented compilation with
	  JIM_ANSIC

2005-04-07 08:52  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c: The ** expr operator, thanks to Richard
	  Suchenwirth.	Limited to integers because pow() needs the
	  inclusion of math.h.	The plan is to put everything depends on
	  math.h in the math lib.

2005-04-06 20:20  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c, jimsh.c: Modified jimsh.c in order to put the
	  directory of the Jim executable as a component of jim_libpath.

2005-04-06 16:16  patthoyts

	* Makefile.vc, jim.c: Add the executable file location into
	  jim_libpath for finding packages.

	* jim-win32.c: Fix a problem with usie of mingw gcc and remove some
	  gcc warnings.

2005-04-06 14:52  patthoyts

	* jim-win32.c: Use __stdcall for mingw

2005-04-06 12:14  patthoyts

	* jim.c, jim.h: Shhhhh. Silenced a number of warnings when using
	  MSVC.

2005-04-06 12:13  patthoyts

	* Makefile.vc, jim-win32.c: Made GetPerformanceInfo dynamically
	  available at runtime only if the relevant library can be loaded.
	  Fixed for impoverished compilers.

2005-04-06 08:35  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c, jim.h: Generic API implementing the Stack data
	  structure exported to extensions.

2005-04-05 19:59  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim-win32.c: Disabled from jim-win32.c commands that
	  need include <psapi.h> because this is not generally available.

2005-04-05 14:18  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c, test.tcl: [scope] command removed. Will be
	  added later with the [let] name and a bit different semantic.

2005-04-05 14:16  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim-rlprompt-1.0.tcl: minor rlprompt fix.

2005-04-05 13:51  antirez

	* ChangeLog, Makefile, jim-readline.c, jim-rlprompt-1.0.tcl, jim.c,
	  jim.h, jimsh.c: .jimrc support (or jimrc.tcl). Minimal readline
	  extension, just enough to allow to the pure-Jim rlprompt
	  extension to provide a readline-aware interactive shell with
	  history.

2005-04-04 21:44  antirez

	* ChangeLog, README, jim.c: Fixed a memory leak introduced some day
	  ago.	Thanks to 'valgrind'.

2005-04-04 13:59  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim-stdlib-1.0.tcl: [memoize] is now inside the Jim
	  Standard Library! More info here: http://wiki.tcl.tk/10981 Our

	  for the rest it is the same.

2005-04-04 10:01  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.h: Version marked as "0.51".

2005-04-04 09:58  antirez

	  comment.)

2005-03-29 15:43  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c: First fix for [rand]. More later as there is an
	  evident bias due to some programming error probably.

2005-03-29 15:38  antirez

	* ChangeLog, Makefile, jim.c, jim.h: A number of fix for commands
	  optimizing a bit too much objects not shared, that didn't played
	  very well with Jim arrays.  Added the [rand] command.

2005-03-28 19:47  antirez

2005-03-21 13:39  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c, test.tcl: Modified test.tcl to report the list
	  of failed tests at the end.

2005-03-21 12:59  chi

	* jim.c, jim.h, test.tcl: Add the [scan] command and the
	  Jim_ScanString function + tests.

	    The scanformat specification will be converted to a new Jim_Obj
	  of type
	  scanFormatStringObjType, that will contain the parsed
	  representation within its internal object representation. This
	  speed up multiple scanning within e.g. a loop, of objects were
	  cached.

	    For internal scanning we use sscanf currently (I am lazy right
	  now). That
	  means also, we will inherit its incapability to handle string
	  with embedded ZERO. It would be not too difficult to implement
	  another scanner just for the string and charset conversion type
	  that could be able to handle those embedded ZEROs, however.

	  Furthermore two small details were fixed:

	  1. Jim_DoubleToString should also recognize a number if a leading
	  '+' or    '-' occured. By recognizing I mean, add a ".0" to such
	  a number.

	  2. Jim_StrDupLen should also properly handle duplication of
	  substrings. So    now it should be possible to do this:

	       const char *str1 = "This is a long string";
	       char *substr1 = Jim_StrDupLen(str1, 4);

	     Now substr1 should contain a properly ZERO ended "This".

	  into C++ programs.

2005-03-14 13:20  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.h: Some change to make jim.h more C++ friendly,
	  still not working with g++ btw.

2005-03-14 10:16  antirez

	* ChangeLog, TODO, jim.c: Removed the inclusion of a not-needed
	  header file "sys/time.h" that prevented compilation with
	  JIM_ANSIC under non POSIX systems.

2005-03-14 08:22  antirez

	* ChangeLog, TODO, jim.c: [lmap] command.

2005-03-13 18:43  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.h: Max nesting depth modified to 10000

2005-03-13 16:53  antirez

2005-03-13 09:36  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c: [string index] implemented

2005-03-12 22:42  antirez

	  -DJIM_ANSIC to use only ANSI-C features and libraries.

2005-03-12 10:18  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c, jim.h: Added the Jim_FreeNewObj() macro to free
	  objects with refcount == 0 instead to call Jim_IncrRefCount +
	  Jim_DecrRefCount(), or directly Jim_FreeObj(). Code modified
	  accordingly where needed.  Make test + valgrind test passed after
	  the change.

2005-03-12 09:52  antirez

	* ChangeLog, README, jim.c: It's now possible to exclude
	  compilation of dynamic loaded libraries commenting the JIM_DYNLIB
	  define from the first lines of jim.c.

2005-03-12 07:43  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c: Modified Jim_Free() to be more strict, now it
	  panics if the refcount of the object is not exactly 0.  Now new
	  objects that are not used may be freed using Jim_Free instead to
	  use Jim_IncrRefCount() + Jim_DecrRefCount() calls.

2005-03-11 23:00  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c: Converted some free() call to Jim_Free().
	  Actually Jim_Free is a macro that just expands to free for now,
	  but in the future Jim may include a specialized allocator for
	  better performances.

2005-03-11 10:37  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c: [lambda] modified to be 'statics' capable.

2005-03-08 18:06  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c, jim.h, jimsh.c: Did some fix in jimsh.c,
	  exported some more API function to set variables and global
	  variables using a string C as name instead of a Jim_Obj. This is
	  more handy in mani conditions.

2005-03-08 16:10  patthoyts

	* bench.tcl, jim.c, jim.h: JIM_VERSION is to be an integer value
	  which we present as MAJOR.MINOR to users. MAJOR is JIM_VERSION /
	  100

	* ChangeLog, jim.c: Fixed a memory leak introduced with the last
	  callframe caching code commit.

2005-03-07 21:34  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c, jim.h: Faster procedure calls (obtained caching
	  the hashtable, and with a fast path to free the cached hash
	  tables elements).

2005-03-07 18:58  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c: Added "increasing", "decreasing", "ascii",
	  "nocase" options to lsort (SS). The plan is to don't add more
	  options than this, but -command, and put "dictionary style"
	  comparison in [string dictcompare].

2005-03-07 17:03  antirez

	* ChangeLog, Makefile, bench.tcl, jim.c: [lsort] command and list

	  version to the command.  Added a simple version of [lsort] (no
	  options yet).

2005-03-07 15:17  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c: specializing version of while (still not
	  complete, but already handles most of the cases that it's worth
	  to optimize).

2005-03-07 09:23  antirez

	* ChangeLog, TODO: TODO changes

2005-03-06 23:42  antirez

	* bench.tcl, jim.c, regtest.tcl, test.tcl: A specializing version
	  of [for] that appears able to match the performaces of Tcl8.4 for
	  the specialized forms. The implementation is a bit complex so may
	  contain bugs... to handle with care.	Also a [for] bug about
	  [continue] was fixed and the regression test added.

2005-03-06 11:43  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c, jim.h, doc/AIO-Extension.txt: Fixed a race
	  condition in the garbage collection code.  In order to fix this,
	  now the hash table iterator works in a way that's save to delete
	  returned entries during the iteration.

	* ChangeLog, doc/AIO-Extension.txt: AIO doc update

2005-03-06 10:03  antirez

	  AIO

2005-03-06 09:31  antirez

	* ChangeLog, Makefile, TODO, jim-aio.c, jim.c, jim.h: Added
	  Jim_GetEnum() API function. StringCoreCommand and AIO extension
	  modified to use this API. There are plenty of other places where
	  this will work better than the raw CompareStringImmediate().
	  Original idea from Tcl, Original implementation from Pat Thoyts,
	  I changed the implementationto use CSI and for automatic error
	  generation with all the valid options listed.

2005-03-05 23:06  patthoyts

	* jim.c: Free an objects internal representation before freeing the
	  string rep.

	* ChangeLog, jim-posix.c, jim-win32.c, jim-win32com.c, jim.c,
	  jim.h: delProc callback added to Jim_CreateCommand().  Core
	  commands handling updated to respect the new sematic.

2005-03-05 13:13  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim-posix.c: extern int errno declaration removed from
	  the posix extension.

2005-03-05 11:45  patthoyts

	* jim.c, jim.h: Added Jim_GetAssocData api. This for permitting
	  packages to register a data structure with a Jim interpreter.

2005-03-05 10:46  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c, jim.h: removed strcasecmp() and isascii(). Now
	  the Jim core is fully ANSI-C excluding the [load] command. I plan
	  to add a JIM_FORCE_ANSIC ifdef to exclude the load command for
	  compilation.

2005-03-05 10:34  antirez

	* AUTHORS, ChangeLog, README, jim.c, jim.h, test.tcl: [switch]
	  command contributed by Clemens Hintze, modified to avoid problems
	  with -command and shimmering of the objects passed as [switch]
	  arguments.

2005-03-04 15:09  antirez

	* BUGS, ChangeLog, jim.c, jim.h, test.tcl: jim::libpath renamed
	  into jim.libpath. Also there was a bug listed in the BUG file
	  about jim.libpath lookup performed using the local variable API

	  Jim_GetGlobalVariableStr() was added.  Jim_GetVariableStr() and
	  Jim_GetGlobalVariableStr() are now exported.

2005-03-04 13:32  antirez

	* jim-win32com.c: Added preliminary support for using typelibrary
	  information

2005-03-03 16:43  antirez

	* jim.c: interactive prompt output binary safe (using fwrite
	  instead of printf).

2005-03-03 16:36  antirez

	* jim.c: [string repeat] implemented.

2005-03-03 16:30  antirez

	* Makefile, jim.c, jim.h: Made exporting of symbols to the API less
	  error prone with JIM_REGISTER_API and JIM_GET_API macros.

2005-03-03 15:41  antirez

	* Makefile, jim.h: improtant fix! jim error message visualization
	  was broken because Jim_PrintErrorMessage() was not exported using
	  the right funciton pointer.

2005-03-03 14:13  antirez

	* Makefile: Makefile dependences updated

2005-03-03 14:10  antirez

	* jim.c, jim.h: changes to the reference system. Now references
	  string rep includes a 'tag' that makes interactive usage and
	  debugging simpler.

2005-03-03 12:01  antirez

	* jim-posix.c, jim.h: Fixed a minor typo introduced with
	  const-safeness patch.

2005-03-03 11:34  antirez

	  and 366 for const correctness to the win32 modules and jim.[ch]

2005-03-03 04:11  patthoyts

	* jim-win32com.c: Fixed my evil unicode type problem. Didn't do a
	  good job with zero length unicode strings.

2005-03-03 02:48  patthoyts

	* jim-win32com.c, jim.c, jim.h: Exported the double object type to
	  the API.  Paranoid cleanup of unicode object type internal
	  representation.

2005-03-02 23:50  antirez

2005-03-02 23:29  antirez

	* README, TODO, bench.tcl, jim.c: one more benchmark

2005-03-02 20:29  antirez

	* jimsh.c: jimsh added

2005-03-02 20:27  antirez

	* Makefile, jim-posix.c, jim-win32.c, jim-win32com.c, jim.c, jim.h:
	  shell and library splitted. Now jim.c contains only the language
	  implementation, while the shell is into jimsh.c, that is actually
	  the first example of embedder of Jim.

	  Important changes in jim.h to make Jim play well with
	  extensions/embedders at the same time, and to deal with multiple
	  files.

	  Extensions now must define JIM_EXTENSION before to include jim.h,
	  embedders must define JIM_EMBEDDED before to include jim.h.

2005-03-02 18:05  antirez

	* jim-posix.c, jim-win32.c, jim-win32com.c: removed JIM_EXTENSION
	  define from extensions. Is no longer useful because only the core
	  has to defile __JIM_CORE__.

	  Added ctype.h in jim-win32com.c.

2005-03-02 17:40  patthoyts

	* Makefile.vc, jim-win32com.c, jim.h: Can now create and relese
	  objects and use ole32.invoke to call propert get on them.  See
	  the sample at the top of the file. NB: ONLY propget so far.

2005-03-02 17:02  antirez

	* jim.c: binary safe JimStringCompare and thus [string compare].
	  Now [string compare] supports -nocase.

2005-03-02 16:41  antirez

	* jim.c, test.tcl: binary safe JimStringMatch()

2005-03-02 15:20  antirez

	* jim-win32.c: win32 compilation under mingw fixed,
	  GetPerformanceInfo() is not available under mingw.

2005-03-02 15:03  antirez

	* jim.c: fix for [ Bug #3513 ] Jim crashed after dict sugar
	  substitution in string

2005-03-02 14:31  antirez

	* jim.c, jim.h: JIM_LL_MODIFIER is now called JIM_WIDE_MODIFIER so
	  that's set simply to "ld" if the system isn't 64bit capable. This
	  allows to remove few ifdefs from jim.c.
