CORE LANGUAGE FEATURES

- Proc default arguments
- Traces
- [static] command

CORE COMMANDS

- All the missing standard core commands not related to I/O, namespaces, ...
- The current [expr] needs a lot of work, expecially operators && and ||
  are not lazy. Math functions are not present but probably will never
  be added as expr functions, but as Tcl commands, like [sin], [cos] and
  so on.
- [onleave] command, executing something as soon as the current procedure
  returns. With no arguments it returns the script set, with one appends
  the onleave script. There should be a way to reset.
- [proc] without arguments may return a list of all the procedures
  (no C commands). While with a single argument (the name of a proc)
  may return [list $args $statics $body].

OTHER COMMANDS NOT IN TCL BUT THAT SHOULD BE IN JIM

- Set commands: [lunion], [lintersect], and [ldifference]

EXTENSIONS LOADING

- Avoid that the same extension can be loaded multiple times inside the
  same interpreter. The extension should return its name on initialization
  together with the version so that Jim_InitExtension will fail if the
  extension with the same name is already loaded.

EXTENSIONS

- Regexp extension
- OOP system
- Event loop
- Files
- Sockets
- Cryptography: hash functions, block ciphers, strim ciphers, PRNGs.
- Tuplespace extension (http://wiki.tcl.tk/3947) (using sqlite as backend)
- Zlib
- Gdlib
- CGI (interface compatible with ncgi, but possibly written in C for speed)

SPEED OPTIMIZATIONS

- Find a way to avoid interpolation/reparsing in "foo($bar)" tokens.
  See the "sieve" and "ary" bench performances, result of this problem.
  (to compare with sieve_dict is also useful.)
- Experiment with better ways to do literal sharing.
- Organize the 'script' object so that a single data structure is
  used for a full command, and interpolation is done using an
  'interpolation token type' like JIM_TT_VAR and so on.
  This way there is no need to run the array if integer objects
  with the command structure. Also should help for better cache usage.
- Generate .c from Jim programs, as calls to the Jim API to avoid
  the performance penality of Jim_EvalObj() overhead. In the future
  try to generate the calls like a JIT emitting assembler from
  Jim directly.
- Jim_GetDouble() should check if the object type is an integer into
  a range that a double can represent without any loss, and directly
  return the double value converting the integer one instead to pass
  for the string repr.

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES

- Objects lazy free.
- Rewrite all the commands accepting a set of options to use Jim_GetEnum().
- Every time an extension is loaded Jim should put the dlopen() (or win32
  equivalent) handle in a list inside the interpreter structure. When
  the interpreter is freed all this handles should be closed with dlclose().
- *AssocData() function should allow to specify a delProc C function like
  in the Tcl API. When the interpreter is destroied all the delProc functions
  should be called to free the memory before to free the interpreter.
- Convert dicts from lists directly without to pass from the string repr.

ERROR MESSAGES

- Display the procedure relative file number where the error happened.
  Like:

  In procedure 'check' line 11, called at file "test.tcl", line 1024

  instead of just:

  In procedure 'check' called at file "test.tcl", line 1024

REFERENCES SYSTEM

- Unify ref/getref/setref/collect/finalize under an unique [ref] command.
- Add a 'call' attribute to references in order to call a given procedure
  if the name of a reference is used as command name.

API FUNCTIONS TO EXPORT

- Jim_FormatString()

RANDOM THINGS TO DO ASAP

- .jimrc loading, using the ENV variable
