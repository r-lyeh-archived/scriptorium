<title>Another Tiny HTTP Server for <productname>eCos</productname></title>

<partintro>
<para>
This package provides an extensible, small footprint, full featured HTTP
server for <productname>eCos</productname>. Many of these features can be
disabled via the configuration tool, thus reducing the footprint of the server.
The server has been written for the FreeBSD network stack.

</itemizedlist>

<para>
Ecos tables are used extensively throught the server to provide a high degree
of customization.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="jimtcl-using">
<title>Starting the server</title>
<para>
In order to start the web server, the user needs to call the function:</para>

<programlisting width=72>
cyg_httpd_start();
</programlisting>

<para>in the application code. The server initialization code spawns a new 
thread which calls <command>init_all_network_interfaces()</command> to 
initialize the TCP/IP stack and then starts the deamon. The function is safe
to call multiple times.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="jimtcl-mime-types">
<title>MIME types</title>
<para>
The server has an internal table with all the recognized mime types. Each time
a file or an internal resource is sent out by the server, its extension is 
searched in this table and if a match is found, the associated MIME type is
then sent out in the header. 

The server already provides entries for the following standard file extensions:

'html', 'htm', 'gif', 'jpg', 'css', 'js', 'png'

and the user is responsible for adding any further entry. The syntax for 
adding an entry is the following:</para>

<para><programlisting width=72>
CYG_HTTPD_MIME_TABLE_ENTRY(entry_label, extension_string, mime_tipe_sting);

entry table      : an identifier unique to this entry
extension string : a string containing the extension for this entry
type_string      : the mime string. The strings for many more mime types 
                   is included in a file in the "doc" directory.
</programlisting></para>

<para>
The following is an example of how to add the Adobe Portable Document Format
<command>pdf</command> MIME type to the table:</para>

<para><programlisting width=72>
CYG_HTTPD_MIME_TABLE_ENTRY(hal_pdf_entry, "pdf", "application/pdf");
</programlisting></para>

<sect2 id="jimtcl-mime-types-chunked">
<title>MIME Types for Chunked Frames</title>
<para>
For chunked frames, which are generally used inside c language callbacks, there
is no file name to match an extension to, and thus the extension to be used
must be passed in the <command>cyg_httpd_start_chunked()</command> call. The
server will then scan the MIME table to find a MIME type to match the extension.

For example, to start a chunked transfer of an <command>html</command> file, 
the following call is used:</para>

<para><programlisting width=72>
cyg_httpd_start_chunked("html");
</programlisting></para>

<para>
In any event, it is the responsibility of the user to make sure that a match to
all used extensions is found in the table search. Failing this, 
the default MIME type specified in the CYGDAT_NET_JIMTCL_DEFAULT_MIME_TYPE
string is returned.</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="jimtcl-callback">
<title>C language callback functions</title>
<para>
The server allows the association of particular URLs to C language callback 
functions. eCos tables are used to define the association between a URL and its
corresponding callback. The syntax of the macro to add callback entries to 
the table is:
</para>

<para><programlisting width=72>
CYG_HTTPD_HANDLER_TABLE_ENTRY(entry_label, url_string, callback);

entry table      : an identifier unique to this entry.
url_string       : a string with the extension url that will be appended to the
                   default directory.
callback         : a function with a prototype:
                   cyg_int32 callback_function(CYG_HTTPD_STATE*); 
                   Return value is ignored - just return 0.
</programlisting></para>

<para>
<command>CYG_HTTPD_STATE*</command> is a pointer to a structure that
contains, among others, a buffer (outbuffer) that can be used to send data
out. The definitions of the structure is in http.h.</para>

<para>
The following is an example of how to add a callback to a function myForm()
whenever the URL /myform.cgi is requested:
</para>

<programlisting width=72>
CYG_HTTPD_HANDLER_TABLE_ENTRY(hal_cb_entry, "/myform.cgi", myForm);
</programlisting>

<para>
and somewhere in the source tree there is a function:</para>

<programlisting>
cyg_int32 myForm(CYG_HTTPD_STATE* p)
{
   cyg_httpd_start_chunked("html");
   strcpy(p->outbuffer, "eCos Web Server");
   cyg_httpd_write_chunked(p->outbuffer, strlen(p->outbuffer))
   cyg_httpd_end_chunked();
}  
</programlisting>

<para>This function also shows the correct method of using the chunked frames
API inside a c language callback and also shows the use of outbuffer to
collect data to send out.</para>

<para>Chunked frames are useful when the size of the frame is not known upfront. 
In this case it possible to send a response in chunks of various sizes, and
terminate it with a null chunk (See RFC 2616 for details). To use chunked 
frames, the <command>cyg_httpd_start_chunked()</command> function is used. 
The prototype is the following:</para>

<programlisting>
ssize_t cyg_httpd_start_chunked(char *);
</programlisting>

<para>The only parameter is the <command>extension</command> to use in the 
search for the MIME type. For most files this will be "html" or "htm" and
it will be searched in the MIME table for an approriate MIME type that will
be sent along in the header. The function returns the number of bytes sent
out.</para>

<para>The chunked frame must be terminated by a call to 
<command>cyg_httpd_end_chunked()</command>:</para>

<programlisting>
void cyg_httpd_end_chunked()(void);
</programlisting>

<para>In between these two calls, the user can call the function
<command>cyg_httpd_write_chunked()</command> to send out data any number of
times. It is important that <command>cyg_httpd_write_chunked()</command> be
the only function used to send data out for chunked frames. This
guarantees that proper formatting of the response is respected.
The prototype for the function is:</para>

<programlisting>
ssize_t cyg_httpd_write_chunked(char* p, int len);
</programlisting>

<para>The 'char*' points to the data to send out, the 'int' is the length of the
data to send.</para>

<para>In the case in which the size of the data is known upfront, the
callback can instead create the header with a call to
<command>cyg_httpd_create_std_header()</command> with the following
prototype:</para>

<programlisting>
void cyg_httpd_create_std_header(char *ext, int len);

extension   : the extension used in the search of the MIME type
len         : length of the data to send out
</programlisting>

<para>and use
<command>cyg_httpd_write()</command> to send data out to the client. The
 prototype of <command>cyg_httpd_write()</command> is the same as 
<command>cyg_httpd_write_chunked()</command></para></sect1>

<sect1 id="jimtcl-cgi">
<title>CGI</title>
<para>
The web server allows writing of pseudo-CGI programs. This is helpful in order
to modify the functionality of the server without having to recompile it and
reflash it.</para>

<para>One way to implement CGI is, of course, the C language callback mechanism
described above: This assumes, of course, that all the callbacks are written
by compile time and cannot be modified later on. Another way to perform the
same functionality is the use of a library in the form of an object file. 
These object files reside in the file system and are loaded, executed and 
unloaded on demand.</para>

<para>Yet a third way is the use of a scripting language. Since full fledged
implementation of the most popular scripting languages such as Python or Perl
are too large for most embedded systems, a slim down implementation of tcl
was chosen for this server. Most of the tcl functionality is still there,
and makes writing cgi a lot easier.</para>

<para>In order to limit the footprint of the operating system support for both
the objloader and the tcl script for dealing with cgi files can be 
independently selected out. Tcl support in particular increases the memory
requirements considerably.
</para>

<sect2 id="jimtcl-cgi-objloader">
<title>CGI via objloader</title>
<para>
In order to use the cgi mechanism the CYGPKG_OBJLOADER must be included
when building the operating system. This will enable the proper option in the
configuration tool and if selected, the necessary code will be compiled
in the eCos kernel. The user will then have to compile the necessary libraries
and place them in the file system under a directory defined by 
CYGDAT_NET_JIMTCL_SERVEROPT_CGIDIR.
When a request is made, the web server checks if the root directory of the 
requested URL is inside the CYGDAT_NET_JIMTCL_SERVEROPT_CGIDIR directory.
If so, the server assumes that the user requested a cgi file and looks into the
directory to see if a library by the same name is present, and if so load it
and tries to execute a function inside the library with the following prototype:
</para>

<programlisting width=72>void exec_cgi(CYG_HTTPD_STATE *)
</programlisting>

<para>
The pointer <command>CYG_HTTPD_STATE*</command> gives access to the socket 
data: The user will use this pointer to access the 'outbuffer' and use it to
copy data to send data out.
</para>

<para>
When using the OBJLOADER package within the HTTP server a number of functions 
are automatically added to the externals table of the OBJLOADER package. These
functions are likely to be used inside the library and the relocator need to 
have a pointer to them. In order to add more functions, see the OBJLOADER
documentation. The complete list of the functions automatically added is:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>cyg_httpd_start_chunked()</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>cyg_httpd_write_chunked()</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>cyg_httpd_find_mime_string()</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Every time the web client issues a GET or POST request for a file with an 
extension of '.o'in the /cgi-bin directory (or whatever path the user chooses 
to hold the libraries) then the library by that name is loaded, run and
when the execution is over, it is dumped from memory.

The library must be compiled separately, using the same toolchain used to 
compile the server and then added to the file system.</para>

<para>In order to reduce the footprint of the server, CGI through OBJLOADER
can be compiled out by unchecking CYGOPT_NET_JIMTCL_USE_CGIBIN_OBJLOADER
in the configuration tool.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="jimtcl-cgi-tcl">
<title>CGI via the simple tcl interpreter</title>
<para>A small tcl interpreter has been added to the web server, and it can
be used to write simple cgi scripts. The interpreter is admittedly very
minimal, and it is only useful for very simple applications, but it is an
excellent starting point for further development.</para>

<para>In order for the scripting language to be useful, it has to access
the form variables passed on during the GET or POST request. Because of
this, all form variables registered with the CYG_HTTPD_FVAR_TABLE_ENTRY()
macro are accessible via tcl. For example, if we have registered a
form variable called foo, and during the GET request we are defining foo
as being "1":</para>

<programlisting width=72>GET /myForm.cgi?foo=1</programlisting>

<para>then tcl will be able to access the variable foo as $foo. The data
in the body of a POST request is also accessible through the use of the variable
$post_data. This is useful if the data is not in "multipart/form-data"
and tcl has to perform any type of processing on the data itself.</para>

<para>In order to send back a response to the client a few functions have been
added to the interpreter. These functions are:</para>

<sect3 id="jimtcl-start-chunked">
<title>start_chunked</title>
<programlisting width=72>start_chunked "extension";</programlisting>
<para>"extension" is a string used to search the 
table of the mime types. For example, to send back to the client an HTML file, 
we can use: start_chunked "html";
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="jimtcl-write-chunked">
<title>write_chunked</title>
<programlisting width=72>write_chunked content;</programlisting>
<para>content is a string to send back to the client. 
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="jimtcl-end-chunked">
<title>end_chunked</title>
<programlisting width=72>end_chunked;</programlisting>
<para>No parameters. Send back an end of frame to the client.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="jimtcl-tcl-hello-world">
<title>tcl hello world example</title>
<para>
The following example demonstrates how to send a log file in the file
<filename>/ram/log</filename> to a web client. It replaces
newline characters with <literal>&lt;br&gt;</literal> so that it is formatted on the
browser correctly.
<programlisting width=72>
start_chunked "html";

set fp [aio.open "/ram/log" r];
$fp seek 0 end;
set fsize [$fp tell];
$fp seek 0 start;
set data "abcxxx";
set data [$fp read $fsize];
$fp close;
set data [string map {\n &lt;br&gt;} $data];

set datax "";
append datax "&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;" $data "&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;";

write_chunked $datax;
end_chunked;
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
The above file should exist on a filesystem
on the embedded target within its <filename class=directory>cgi-bin</filename>
directory, for example as <filename>/cgi-bin/hello.tcl</filename>. Thereafter
it may be accessed at the URL
<literal>http://<replaceable>TARGET_NAME</replaceable>/cgi-bin/hello.tcl</literal>.
</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="jimtcl-authentication">
<title>Authentication</title>
<para>
The server supports both Basic (base64) and Digest (MD5) authentication, 
although they have not been tested with all clients. In this implementation, 
the contents of certain directories of the file system can be protected, such
that the user will be required to issue a username/password to access the
content of the directory.</para>

<para>To protect a directory with a basic authentication, there is a 
specific macro:</para>

<programlisting>
CYG_HTTPD_AUTH_TABLE_ENTRY(entry, path, domain, un, pw, mode)

entry            : an identifier unique to this entry.
path             : the path to the directory whose content must be
                    authenticated before it is sent out
domain           : a domain identifier for this directory.
un               : username for authentication
pw               : password for authentication
mode             : CYG_HTTPD_AUTH_BASIC for base64 encoding or 
                   CYG_HTTPD_AUTH_DIGEST for MD5 encoding
</programlisting>

<para>for example, to require basic authentication of the content of directory 
"/ecos/" with a username of "foo" and password "bar", the following is used:
</para>

<programlisting>
CYG_HTTPD_AUTH_TABLE_ENTRY(hal_domain1_entry,          \
                           "/ecos/",    "ecos_domain", \
                           "foo",       "bar",         \
                           CYG_HTTPD_AUTH_BASIC);
</programlisting>

<para>Any request for a file in the directory /ecos/ will now trigger a
credential check. These credentials, once provided, are automatically sent by
the client for every request within the particular domain.</para>

<para>It must be noticed that the path name set in the macro is relative to the
HTML document directory, CYGDAT_NET_HTTPD_SERVEROPT_HTMLDIR and it is the
first part of the path provided by the client request (including the leading
slash).</para>

<para>In order to reduce the footprint of the server, authentication
is not enabled by default, and so the option CYGOPT_NET_JIMTCL_USE_AUTH must
be used to enable support for basic and digest authentication.</para>

<para>The MD5 digest authentication support is implemented using the RSA
Data Security, Inc. MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm. Derivative works with
MD5 digest authentication included must be identified as "derived from the
RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm" in all material
mentioning or referencing the derived work. See the file md5.c within this
package for license details.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="jimtcl-dirlist">
<title>Directory Listing</title>

<para>If the user issues a "GET" request with a URL terminating in a slash, the
server will try to locate one of the following index files in the directory,
choosing one in the following order:</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>index.html</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>index.htm</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>default.html</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>home.html</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>If any of these files is found, its contents are sent back
to the client. If no such file is found the server uses the user-provided
index file name (if any is specified with the CYGDAT_NET_JIMTCL_ALTERNATE_HOME
setting. Failing all this a directory listing is sent.</para>

<para>Trailing slash redirection for directory names is supported.</para>

<para>In order to reduce the footprint of the server, directory listing can
be disabled by unchecking CYGOPT_NET_JIMTCL_USE_DIRLIST. The savings are
substantial since directory listing also makes use of a few internal
resources (gif files) which are also compiled out.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="jimtcl-formvars">
<title>Form Variables</title>

<para>The server will automatically try to parse form variables when a form is
submitted in the following cases:

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>In a GET request, when the URL is followed by a question
                  mark sign</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>In a POST request, when the the 'Content-Type' header line
                  is set to 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

The variable names to look for during the parsing are held in
an eCos table. In order to take advantage of this feature, the user first
adds the variable names to the table, which also requires providing a buffer 
where the parsed value will eventually be stored. The values will then be
available in the buffers during the processing of the request, presumably in
the body of a c language callback or CGI script.</para>

<para>For example, if the user wants two form variables, "foo" and "bar", to 
be parsed automatically, those variable names must be added to the table 
with the following macro:</para>

<programlisting>
CYG_HTTPD_FVAR_TABLE_ENTRY(entry, name, buffp, bufflen)

entry            : an identifier unique to this entry.
name             : name of the form variable
buffp            : a pointer to a buffer of characters where to store the value
                   of the form variable.
bufflen          : The length of the buffer. Must include a trailing string
                   terminator.
</programlisting>

<para>or, in the specific instance mentioned above:</para>

<programlisting>
#define HTML_VAR_LEN   20
char var_foo[HTML_VAR_LEN];
char var_bar[HTML_VAR_LEN];
CYG_HTTPD_FVAR_TABLE_ENTRY(hal_form_entry_foo, "foo", var_foo, HTML_VAR_LEN);
CYG_HTTPD_FVAR_TABLE_ENTRY(hal_form_entry_bar, "bar", var_bar, HTML_VAR_LEN);
</programlisting>

<para>and after the GET or POST submissions, the list will contain the value 
for "foo" and "bar" (if they were found in the form data.) It is the 
responsability of the user to make sure that the buffer is large enough
to hold all the data parsed (including the string terminator). The parser will
write only up to the length of the buffer minus one (the last being the
terminator) and discard any additional data.</para>

<para>The values parsed are likely going to be used in c language callback, or
in CGI files. In a c language callback the user can directly access the pointers
of individual variables for further processing, keeping in mind that the parsing 
always result in a string of characters to be produced, and any conversion
(e.g. from strings to integer) must be performed within the callback. In
a TCL script the user can just access a variable by its name. For example,
in the case of the variables 'foo' and 'bar' shown above, it is possible
to do something like 'write_chunked "You wrote $foo". The data that was sent in
the body of a POST request is accessible in through a variable called
'post_data'. In CGI functions
implemented using the objloader the pointers to the
variables cannot be accessed directly, since the library will likely not
know their location in memory. The proper way to access them is by using the
cyg_httpd_find_form_variable() function from within the library:</para>

<programlisting>
char* cyg_httpd_find_form_variable(char* name)

name             : name of the form variable to look up

returns a pointer to the buffer, or 0 if the variable was not found.
</programlisting>

<para>When using the OBJLOADER package within the web server, an entry
for the cyg_httpd_find_form_variable() function is automatically added to the
externals table the OBJLOADER for relocation. See the OBLOADER paragraph of 
the ATHTTP user's guide for the full list of the exported functions.</para>

<para>In order to avoid stale data, all the buffers in the table are cleared
before running the parser and thus any variable in the list that was not
assigned a new value dureing the request will be an empty string.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="jimtcl-ires">
<title>Internal Resources</title>

<para>When the server does not use a file system the user must be responsible
to provide a C language callback function for each URL that will be
requested by the client. This means locating the data and sending it out
using either <command>cyg_httpd_write()</command> or
<command>cyg_httpd_write_chunked()</command>.</para>

<para>In order to simplify this process the server allows registering
any number of URLs as internal resources, by providing the URL name, the
pointer to the resource data and its size. When a URL is requested the
server will look it up among all internal resources, and if found, it
will send out the resource.</para>

<para>Internal resource can also be used along with a file system. In this
case the file system is searched first, and if a file is found, it it
sent. If a file is not found, the internal resources are searched and
if a match if found it is sent.</para>

<para>The drawback of this approach is, of course, that all these
resources are going to add to the size of the operating system image, and thus
it should be used only when memory is not a major constraint of the 
design.</para>

<para>As always, to provide this type of customization, ecos tables are used.
The format for adding a new resource to the internal table is the following:
</para>

<programlisting>
CYG_HTTPD_IRES_TABLE_ENTRY(entry, name, buffp, len)

entry            : an identifier unique to this entry.
name             : name of the URL including leading '/'
buffp            : a pointer to a buffer of characters where to store the value
                   of the form variable.
len              : size of the array                   
</programlisting>

<para>As an example, if the user wants to provide his own web page by
hardcoding it in the application code, here is how he would do it:</para>

<programlisting>
#define MY_OWN_HOME_PAGE "eCos RTOS"
CYG_HTTPD_IRES_TABLE_ENTRY(cyg_httpd_ires_home,       \
                           "/index.html",             \
                           MY_OWN_HOME_PAGE,          \
                           9);
</programlisting>

<para>The extension of the file name determines the MIME type to be used for
internal resources.</para>

<para>When using directory listing you are implicitly making use of internal
resources. The small icons that appear to the left of file names and
directories are internal resources. Unchecking CYGOPT_NET_HTTP_USE_DIRLIST
will prevent the addition of these files.</para>

<para>In order to use internal resources, a generic file must first be
turned into a c language array, which is then compiled in the application
code. To create this array you can use the tcl script that comes with the
ecos distribution at packages/fs/rom/current/support/file2.tcl.</para>
